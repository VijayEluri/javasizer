Use this library to estimate the size of a java object graph.  The library will traverse the graph using reflection and use JVM instrumentation to estimate the size of the Objects in your JVM.

This library must be added as a javaagent to your JVM as it relies on the java.lang.instrument.Instrumentation class.

usage:
	java -javaagent:pathto.jar -classpath pathto.jar
	
in your code:
	org.jh.Size.sizeof(object)
